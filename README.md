## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts

**I added one other feature**
- Add a reset button to reset the timer

## My process

### Built with

- [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### What I learned

I wanted to use this project to learn how to write in *TypeScript*, create custom *React Hooks*, and write css using *Sass*.  There were also unexpected areas that I learned when it comes to using *React Context*.



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```
